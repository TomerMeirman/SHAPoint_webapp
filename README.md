A **Streamlit web application** for interactive risk assessment using **SHAPoint** - an interpretable, task-agnostic risk scoring framework based on SHAP and decision trees.

## Overview

SHAPoint WebApp provides an intuitive web interface for the [SHAPoint](https://github.com/TomerMeirman/SHAPoint) package, enabling users to:

- **Build interpretable risk models** from healthcare or other tabular datasets
- **Visualize feature importance** and model explanations in real-time
- **Calculate individual risk scores** with population-based comparisons
- **Retrain models** with different parameters through the web interface
- **Export and reuse trained models** for production deployments

This webapp serves as both a **research tool** and **clinical decision support interface**, making advanced machine learning interpretability accessible to domain experts without programming experience.

**Important Note**: This webapp currently supports **Classification tasks only**. Support for Survival analysis and Regression tasks is planned for future releases.

## Relationship to SHAPoint

This package is a **web interface wrapper** for the core [SHAPoint](https://github.com/TomerMeirman/SHAPoint) library (v0.1.0). The webapp handles:

- **User Interface**: Streamlit-based interactive components
- **Visualization**: Plotly charts for risk assessment and feature analysis  
- **Configuration Management**: YAML-based settings with auto-detection
- **Model Persistence**: Saving and loading trained models
- **Real-time Updates**: Live risk calculation as inputs change

The core machine learning functionality is provided by **SHAPoint v0.1.0**.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI (when available)
pip install shapoint-webapp

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/TomerMeirman/SHAPoint_webapp.git
cd SHAPoint_webapp
pip install -e .
```

### Dependencies

The webapp requires **SHAPoint v0.1.0** and will automatically install it:

```bash
# Core dependencies
shapoint>=0.1.0
streamlit>=1.46.0
plotly>=6.0.0
pyyaml>=6.0
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.20.0
```

### Running the Application

**Option 1: Using CLI (recommended after dev install)**
```bash
# Activate virtual environment & install in dev mode
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -e .

# Run the app with CLI
shapoint-webapp
```

**Option 2: Direct package run**
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac

# Run the app
streamlit run shapoint_webapp/app.py
```

**Option 2: Using the provided scripts**
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
.\run_webapp.ps1

# Windows Command Prompt  
.\run_app.bat

# Or use the included Python launcher
python start_app.py
```

**Option 3: Using the command-line interface (after installation)**
```bash
shapoint-webapp
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

- **üìä Population Analytics**: Risk distribution analysis and bin-based statistics
- **‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Configuration**: Auto-detection of feature types and metadata
- **üíæ Model Persistence**: Save and reload trained models

### User Interface

- **üì± Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **üé® Clean Interface**: Intuitive layout with organized feature input forms
- **üìã Real-time Updates**: Instant risk calculation as inputs change
- **üìà Interactive Charts**: Plotly-based visualizations with hover details
- **‚ö° Performance Optimized**: Caching for fast model predictions

### Advanced Features

- **üîÑ Model Retraining**: Adjust parameters without leaving the interface
- **üìã Risk Bins Configuration**: Dynamic risk binning for population analysis
- **üìä Feature Selection**: Include/exclude features from model training
- **üéØ Rule-based Scoring**: Transparent score calculation based on decision rules

## üìã Configuration

The webapp uses a YAML configuration file that automatically detects most settings:

```yaml
# config.yaml
model:
  k_variables: 5              # Number of top features
  score_scale: 10             # Maximum risk score
  risk_bins: 8                # Population analysis bins

data:
  target_column: "outcome"    # Prediction target
  exclude_columns: ["id"]     # Columns to ignore
  
  # Optional: Override auto-detection
  feature_metadata:
    age:
      label: "Patient Age"
      min_value: 18
      max_value: 100
```

Most feature properties (types, ranges, labels) are **automatically detected** from your dataset.

## üè• Use Cases

### Healthcare Applications
- **Cardiovascular Risk Assessment**: Predict heart disease risk from clinical factors
- **Cancer Prognosis**: Estimate survival probability from biomarkers
- **Treatment Response**: Predict therapy effectiveness from patient characteristics

### General Risk Modeling
- **Financial Risk**: Credit scoring and loan default prediction
- **Operational Risk**: Equipment failure and maintenance scheduling  
- **Security Risk**: Fraud detection and anomaly identification

## üìñ Example Usage

```python
# For programmatic access (optional)
from shapoint_webapp import ModelManager
import yaml

# Load configuration
with open('config.yaml', 'r') as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Initialize model manager
manager = ModelManager(config)

# Train model
model = manager.load_or_train_model()

# Make predictions
risk_result = manager.predict_risk({
    'age': 65,
    'cholesterol': 2,
    'blood_pressure': 140
})

print(f"Risk Score: {risk_result['risk_score']}")
print(f"Risk Percentage: {risk_result['risk_percentage']}%")
```
